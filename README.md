<h2>Welcome to Nestor</h2>

Nestor is a web application framework for creating content management scenarios that I designed and built while working at Cultivate Learning, a University of Washington grant funded center supporting and improving the quality of early childhood education.

The core web application framework found here has been release as open source under the MIT License. The Nestor components code used to create specific web applications used at Cultivate Learning however have not been released as open source, reflecting my agreement with leadership.

<h3>Notes</h3>

The installer is very utilitarian and was built by a member of my team. It works, but could stand to be rewritten.

Documentation can be found at <a href="https://nestor-cms.github.io/documentation/index.htm">https://nestor-cms.github.io/documentation/index.htm</a>, but is however extremely out of date.
